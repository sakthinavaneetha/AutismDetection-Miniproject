## Autism Detection: A Data-Driven Solution
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) Need for Objective Screening: Machine learning can help create more consistent and objective early screening tools for Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD).

## About
Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) ASD is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and repetitive behaviors. Early diagnosis is critical for better outcomes. Why Autism Prediction? The purpose of the Autism Prediction Using Machine Learning project is to leverage machine learning techniques to develop an automated system that can accurately predict Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) in its early stages based on behavioral and developmental data.

## Features
The project aims to achieve the following objectives -Improve diagnostic accuracy -Enhance efficiency and speed -Enable early intervention -Provide an accessible tool that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis.

## Requirements
Operating System: 64-bit Windows 10, macOS, or Ubuntu. Python Version: Python 3.8 or later. Frameworks: TensorFlow (2.5+), PyTorch for deep learning; scikit-learn for traditional ML. Data Libraries: Pandas, NumPy for data handling; Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization. IDE: VSCode or Jupyter Notebook. Version Control: Git for collaborative work. Optional Deployment Tools: Flask/Django for web deployment, Docker for containerization. Hardware: NVIDIA GPU (CUDA-enabled), 8GB+ RAM (16GB recommended). Additional Libraries: OpenCV for image handling, SHAP/LIME for model explainability, joblib for model saving.

Detection Accuracy: 96.7%
Note: These metrics can be customized based on your actual performance evaluations.


## Results and Impact
The autism detection mini-project developed a model to assist in early autism screening by preprocessing data, training classification models, and evaluating them with metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. The model’s high sensitivity helps ensure that most true cases are identified, while strong precision reduces false positives, making it reliable for initial screenings. This tool supports early detection, potentially leading to timely interventions and optimized resource allocation in healthcare. Its data-driven approach also allows for adaptability to larger datasets, broadening accessibility to autism screening. 

The project demonstrates how machine learning can aid in critical health diagnostics efficiently.
